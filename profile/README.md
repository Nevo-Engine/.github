# üîß Nevo Engine

**A lightweight C++ game engine for developers who value performance, simplicity, and control.**

---

## About Us

We‚Äôre building **Nevo Engine**‚Äîa 3D game engine tailored for indie developers who are comfortable with C++ and prefer data-oriented design. The project began from a desire for more control and less reliance on tools we didn‚Äôt fully align with. We‚Äôre developing a toolchain that fits our workflow and priorities.

Nevo isn‚Äôt trying to replace existing engines. It‚Äôs designed for developers who prefer code over GUI-heavy workflows and want to work close to the metal.

## üß≠ Philosophy

* **Developer-first** ‚Äî Built for experienced developers familiar with game architecture
* **Minimal abstractions** ‚Äî Transparent systems, minimal black-box behavior
* **Focused scope** ‚Äî Prioritizing stability, performance, and clean design over feature bloat
* **Selective community** ‚Äî Quality collaboration over broad accessibility

## üöß Current Development

### Nevo Engine

*A 3D engine focused on clarity, performance, and full developer control*

**Status:** Alpha ‚Äì Core systems functional, major components in progress

**Current Features:**

* Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture
* Component and scripting support
* Basic DirectX 11 rendering pipeline
* Integration with libraries

**Next Milestones:**

1. Core architecture refinements
2. Improved rendering and lighting systems
3. Physics integration via PhysX
4. Demonstration projects to validate engine workflows

**Platform Support:** Windows (DirectX 11). Future platforms may be considered.

## ü§ù Getting Involved

### Using the Engine:

The engine is currently closed source and shared selectively with developers aligned with our vision and approach. At this stage, minimal documentation is provided, and GUI tooling is limited.

### Contributing:

We welcome contributions from experienced developers who are:

* Proficient in modern C++
* Comfortable with low-level systems and incomplete documentation
* Able to work independently with high code quality standards

### What We Don‚Äôt Provide:

* Step-by-step setup guides
* General feature requests without code contributions
* Beginner onboarding or mentoring
* Production-ready stability guarantees

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Nevo Engine is in early development. Breaking changes are expected, and features may be incomplete or unstable. It's intended for developers comfortable with evolving systems and experimental workflows.

Our priority is to support our own game development needs. Collaboration is welcome from like-minded developers who share this goal.
